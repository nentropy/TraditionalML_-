# TradML Algos

I aim to understand each core ML Algorithm deeply and port across the code by this contributor to the Github community with his ML from Scratch.

To supplement this work it is important for me to understand the mathematics as well as the syntactical aspects of implemention. Helping with Rust, Mojo and any other low level language.

## Functionality:
- Datasets and DataLoaders
- ML Algorithms

## Algos implemented:
- LinReg
- LogReg
- DecisionTrees
- RandomForest
- KMeans (Unsupervized Clustering)
