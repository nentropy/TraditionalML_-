"""
Random Forests:

An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction.
It uses bagging (bootstrap aggregating) to create subsets of the training data for each tree.
Random feature selection is employed at each split to decorrelate the trees.
It is robust to overfitting and can handle high-dimensional data.

params:

n_estimators: Int32  # Number of trees in the forest
max_depth: Int32  # Maximum depth of each tree
min_samples_split: Int32  # Minimum number of samples required to split an internal node
criterion: String  # Function to measure the quality of a split
bootstrap: Boolean  # Whether to use bootstrap samples

returns:

forest: Object  # The trained random forest model
feature_importances: Tensor[DType.float32]  # Aggregated importance of each feature across all trees
